That might be a good starting point for an answer.\n\nThen there are different schools of thought: existentialism emphasizes individual choice and freedom, while religion often provides answers through faith and spiritual beliefs. Maybe I should mention these as part of the discussion.\n\nI should also consider if there's any scientific angle here too, like how evolution plays into human existence but not necessarily giving a specific answer about purpose or meaning beyond what we choose ourselves.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for \"the\" meaning of life.
