But since the user might be looking for a general answer or maybe they're testing if I can provide multiple viewpoints.\n\nI remember that in philosophy, there's no single answer. So maybe start by acknowledging that it varies but then present some common views.\n\nAlso, the user might not know all these perspectives so explaining them in simple terms would help. Maybe mention religious views like Christianity with Jesus' teachings or Buddhism with enlightenment? Then move on to existentialism where people create their own meaning?\n\nBut wait, the user is asking for an answer here, so I need to make sure it's comprehensive yet not too technical. Also check if there are any cultural considerations? Probably not necessary unless specified.\n\nWait, but how do I",
