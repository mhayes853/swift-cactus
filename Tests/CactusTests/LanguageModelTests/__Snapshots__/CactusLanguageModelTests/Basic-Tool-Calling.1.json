The user mentioned calling any of the listed functions, so first I need to check what function is available for getting weather information.\n\nLooking at the example tool call syntax provided: it's an object with \"tool_calls\" under \"arguments\". The function name is \"get_weather\", which requires a parameter called \"location\" with a minimum length of 1 character. The user is asking about Santa Cruz, so I need to make sure the location parameter is set correctly.\n\nWait, the example uses \"San Francisco\" as a placeholder for the city name. So in this case, Santa Cruz should be passed as \"Santa Cruz\". The function parameters specify that \"location\" must have at least one character (which it does), and type is string. \n\nI should structure the tool call accordingly: {\"tool_calls\": [{\"name\": \"get_weather\", \"arguments\": {\"",
