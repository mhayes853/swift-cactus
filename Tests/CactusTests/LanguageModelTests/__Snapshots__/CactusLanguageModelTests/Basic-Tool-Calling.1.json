I need to use the get_weather function here because it's designed to retrieve weather information based on a location parameter. The function requires the \"location\" key with the city name provided as \"San Francisco\". Since San Francisco is a specific location, I should pass that directly into the function call. There's no mention of needing additional parameters, so I don't see any other arguments required for this tool call. Just make sure the location string matches exactly as provided by the user.\n<\/think>",
