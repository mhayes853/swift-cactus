The available tool is get_weather, which requires a location parameter.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any specific information needed. The user wants both today's temperature and the forecast. But wait, does the tool return both? If not, maybe I should ask if they want only today's data or include forecasts. However, since the question is asking specifically about today's temperature and forecast, perhaps I should confirm that using the function would provide those details.\n\nWait, but maybe there's confusion here. The user might not know if the function returns forecasts or just temperatures. So after getting the data from `get_weather`, do we need to check if there's additional information available in the response? If not, then perhaps I should inform them that only today's temperature is provided and mention that forecasts are included in future updates.\n\nBut since I can't access external data",
