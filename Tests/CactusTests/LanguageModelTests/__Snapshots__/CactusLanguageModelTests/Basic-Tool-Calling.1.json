The parameters require a location, so I should specify 'Santa Cruz' as the city name.\n\nWait, do I know if Santa Cruz is in a specific region or country? Maybe it's in Argentina since that's where it's located. But regardless, I'll just pass 'Santa Cruz' as the location parameter.\n\nSo putting it all together: {\"location\": \"Santa Cruz\"} should do it. Let me double-check if there are any other required fields or if I missed anything else.\n**Final Answer**\nThe correct JSON request would be: \\boxed{{\"location\": \"Santa Cruz\"}}\n``` \n\nI think that's all! The key point was making sure the location parameter was correctly set to 'Santa Cruz' without adding extra information.\n``` \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{{\"location\": \"Santa Cruz\"}}\n```\n\n\nOkay, so the user wants me",
