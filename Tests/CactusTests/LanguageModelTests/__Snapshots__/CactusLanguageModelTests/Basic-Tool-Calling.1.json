The user wants to know what's currently raining there.\n\nFirst, I should check if there are any functions provided that can get this information. Looking at the system message, one of them is an \"get_weather\" function with parameters expecting \"location\". So I need to call that function with \"Santa Cruz\" as the location argument.\n\nI'll structure my response by calling the get_weather function and then present a JSON object containing the weather data from that call. This should give you the user's requested information.\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that I'm using the correct tool and providing accurate results based on what is available.\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\nThe function call would be made with `get_weather(\"location\", \"Santa Cruz\")`, which returns a JSON object containing weather data for Santa Cruz.
