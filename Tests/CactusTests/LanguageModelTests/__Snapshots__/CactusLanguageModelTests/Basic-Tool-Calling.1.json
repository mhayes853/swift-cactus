The user mentioned \"get_weather\" function, so I should use that tool.\n\nThe parameters require a location name in city format like \"San Francisco\". Since the user asked for Santa Cruz, I'll input that as \"Santa Cruz\" into the function call parameters.\n\nWait, does \"Santa Cruz\" have exactly 10 characters? Let me count: S-A-N-T-C-U-R-O-S... Hmm, maybe I should check if there's any typo or extra spaces. But since the function expects exactly 10 characters (as per example), perhaps \"Santa Cruz\" is correct here. \n\nI need to make sure that the location parameter is properly formatted with no spaces or special characters. Once confirmed, I can generate the tool call with \"location\": \"Santa Cruz\".\n<\/think>\n\n{\n  \"tool",
