Let me start by recalling my knowledge on philosophy and existentialism.\n\nIn philosophy, meaning can be subjective or objective depending on cultural values. Existentialists like Sartre emphasize personal responsibility for one's actions. But what does that mean for \"meaning\"? Maybe it means living authentically? Or is there something else?\n\nWait, maybe I should break down \"meaning\" into parts. The original question is asking for the meaning of life in this context. So perhaps it's a translation issue? If it's \"meaning of life\" in English, then the answer would focus on personal values and purpose. But if there was a specific term like \"meaning of life\" in another language or context?\n\nAlternatively, could it be referring to existential meaning? For example, Sartre said that living authentically is the truest meaning of human existence.",
