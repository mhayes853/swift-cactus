I don't have a tool specifically designed for general queries like getting the current temperature or population statistics across multiple cities at once. However, if you're interested in knowing the current temperature or population of a specific city like San Francisco, I'd be happy to help with that! Let me know how else I can assist you.<|im_end|>",
