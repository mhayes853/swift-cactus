First, they probably need a basic set of materials: cups and maybe some utensils like chopsticks or spoons.\n\nI should mention different types of cups since there are many styles out there. Maybe suggest something everyday like a ceramic mug or an aluminum one for durability and heat resistance. Also, considering the user's preference for specific features—like color or size—should be mentioned as options.\n\nWait, but I should ask if they want it made from recycled materials first because that's part of sustainability in modern times. Then move on to the process step by step: choosing materials, preparing the cup (if needed), assembling it with tools and screws, testing its functionality before using.\n\nOh right! Including tips on how to test if it works well is important so they know before finalizing their project. Also, making sure to cover any potential issues like leaks or improper",
