      "response" : "The meaning of life is a profound and often elusive question that has puzzled philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries. It's a question that varies widely from person to person based on their beliefs, values, and experiences. Some might find it in the pursuit of knowledge or enlightenment; others may seek fulfillment through relationships or personal achievements.\n\nOne perspective suggests that life's meaning lies in the pursuit of happiness (eudaimonia) or living a fulfilling existence by embracing one’s passions and contributing positively to society (altruism). Others believe it comes from making meaningful connections with others through love, kindness, and empathy.\n\nUltimately, defining \"the meaning of life\" is deeply personal; it requires introspection about what truly matters to each individual and aligning those values with their actions and choices.\nRef: [PhilosophyOfLife]<|im_end|>",

Since there's no direct question here, maybe they have an example or context in mind.\n\nWait, the initial message from the user was just text without any problem statement. Maybe they added it later? Let me check again: \"What is 2 + 3?\" No that's not it. The original query might be missing something else.\n\nHmm... Could there be confusion with another part of their message? Like maybe a code snippet or an equation that got mixed up? For example, if someone wrote \"2+3=5\" but forgot to add spaces between numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about a different math topic but made a typo. Since I can't see their full history, I should prompt them for more details.\n\nI need to make sure my response is helpful and guides them towards understanding the problem they",
