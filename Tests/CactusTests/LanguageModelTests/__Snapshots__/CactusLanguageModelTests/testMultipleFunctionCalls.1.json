I need to check if that's available in the tools provided.\n\nLooking at the functions, there is a get_weather function with parameters for location and units. The parameters require 'location' as a string and 'units' as an enum between celsius or fahrenheit.\n\nThe user hasn't specified any particular city or unit yet. So I should ask them to provide both location and units so I can use it properly.\n\nWait, but maybe they just want me to prompt for those details? Since they haven't given any specific info yet, I should respond by requesting that information.\n<\/think>\n\nTo use the `get_weather` function, please provide:\n1. **Location** (e.g., \"London\", \"Paris\")\n2. **Units** (e.g., \"celsius\", \"farenheit\")\n\nOnce you supply these details, I'll retrieve the weather information for you!<|im_end|>",
