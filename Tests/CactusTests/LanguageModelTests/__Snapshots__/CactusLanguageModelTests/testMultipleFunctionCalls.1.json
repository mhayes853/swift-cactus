Let me check what tools I have available.\n\nFirst, there's a function called get_weather that requires a location parameter. Since they want to know about Berkeley, I need to use that function with location set to 'Berkeley'. Then there's another function get_population which also needs a city name. But wait, does the user ask for both data points? Yes.\n\nI should call get_weather first with \"Berkeley\" as the location and then call get_population with \"Berkeley\" as well. Each of these functions will return their respective data points. So I'll make two separate function_call JSON objects for each tool.\n<\/think>\n\n",
