But since I don't have data on their location, I can't call the functions directly without more info.\n\nWait, maybe they expect me to ask for their location first? Or perhaps they just want a general response? Let me check the tools available again. There's get_weather and get_population functions that require a location parameter.\n\nHmm, but if I don't have that info... should I prompt them to provide it? The previous message shows that when there's no data, we can use multiple function_call JSON objects even if one is missing. So maybe respond with an empty function_call until the user provides their city?\n\nYes! That makes sense. Let them know they need to specify a city first.\n<\/think>\n\nYou need to provide a specific city name for either the weather or population information. Could you please share the location you're interested in?<|im_end|>",
