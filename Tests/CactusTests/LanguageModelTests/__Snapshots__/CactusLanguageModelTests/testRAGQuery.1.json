Swift's async\/await syntax, introduced in Swift 5.5, provides a more readable and maintainable way to write concurrent code compared to completion handlers and callbacks.\n\nWhen you mark a function as async, it can suspend execution while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete without blocking the current thread. The await keyword indicates a suspension point where the function can pause and resume later when the operation finishes.\n",

To prevent this, Swift provides weak and unowned references. Weak references are optional and set to nil when the referenced instance is deallocated, while unowned references assume they will always have a value.\n",
