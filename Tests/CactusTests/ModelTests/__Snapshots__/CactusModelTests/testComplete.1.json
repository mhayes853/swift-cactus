At its core, it asks whether life exists for a purpose or if we are meant to find our own purpose. Here’s an exploration of this question from multiple philosophical perspectives:\n\n1. **Existentialism**  \n   Rooted in the idea that humans create their own meaning through choice and action. Philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre argued that existence precedes essence—life begins without inherent purpose but evolves through personal agency and creativity (e.g., writing poetry or building a house). This view emphasizes freedom and responsibility: we must define our values to give life direction.\n\n2. **Religious Perspectives**  \n   Many religions frame the meaning of life as aligned with divine purposes, such as love, compassion, or spiritual growth (e.g., Christianity's focus on relationships, Buddhism’s pursuit of enlightenment). These frameworks often suggest that life is a journey toward transcendence or harmony with universal principles.\n\n3. **Humanistic Thought**  \n   Emphasizing human potential over external validation, this approach highlights purpose through self-actualization.
