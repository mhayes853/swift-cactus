  "content" : "The power of a god cannot be overcome. Zanzar, this is the providence of the world. Even gods are merely being restricted to the limited power determined by prophets that power. Although great is not unlimited, that voice outbreaks how dare you disobey me? I am Manaag and I was here at the beginning and I will proclaim The End Rebirth. That's impossible. Look, it is time for you to choose. Does this world belong to Zanzar or does it belong to you? That is something I decide it long ago! BANG!! We use our power to fell a god and their deeds are destiny. It's fainting the memory of a godly existence born from the chaos of creation."
