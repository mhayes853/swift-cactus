  "content" : "The power of a god cannot be overcome. Zanzar, this is the providence of the world. Even gods are merely being restricted to the limited power determined by promise that power over great is not unlimited. That voice! How dare you disobey me? I am manata, i was here at the beginning and i will proclaim the end. Rebecca, that's impossible. Look, it is time for you to choose does this world belong to Zanzar or does it belong to whom? That is something i decide it long ago! BAHHH!!!! ! We use our power to fell a god and then these are destiny!!! It's fainting the memory of a godly existence born from the chaos of creation."
