Let me check what tools I have available.\n\nLooking at the provided information, there's a function called get_weather that requires a location parameter. The example shows using this function with \"location\" set to San Francisco. Since the user wants to know the weather here, I need to call this function with \"San Francisco\" as the location parameter.\n\nI should make sure there are no other parameters needed for this function, which seems straightforward. The description says it takes one required parameter: location of type string. So inputting \"San Francisco\" should get the correct weather data.\n\nNo other tools are listed here, so I don't need to call any additional functions. Just use get_weather with San Francisco as the argument.\n<\/think>",
