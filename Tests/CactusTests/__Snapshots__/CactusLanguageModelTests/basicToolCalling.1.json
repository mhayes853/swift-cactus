Yes, it's listed as a tool_call in the provided examples.\n\nThe parameters required for get_weather are location. The user specified San Francisco, so I should pass \"San Francisco\" as the location parameter. Since there's only one function available for weather checks here (get_weather), I don't need any other tools. Just call get_weather with location set to San Francisco.\n<\/think>",
