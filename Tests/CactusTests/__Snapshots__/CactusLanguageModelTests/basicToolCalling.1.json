The function requires a location parameter, which in this case is \"San Francisco\". Since the user specified the city name directly without needing additional parameters like state or coordinates (as per the example given), I should pass \"San Francisco\" as the location argument. There's no indication that they want more details beyond just the current weather, so I'll proceed with calling the function with exactly \"San Francisco\". No other tools are needed here since it's a straightforward request.\n<\/think>",
