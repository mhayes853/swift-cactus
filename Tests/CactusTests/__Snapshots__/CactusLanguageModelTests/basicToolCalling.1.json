The provided function is get_weather, which requires a location parameter as a string. Since the user specified San Francisco, I can use this function with \"San Francisco\" as the location.\n\nI should make sure there are no other parameters needed for this function. The description mentions the location to get the weather, so passing \"San Francisco\" should suffice here. There's no indication that additional details like date or time are required for this query.\n\nNow, I need to structure the tool_call correctly according to the example provided. The JSON object should have \"tool_calls\" as an array containing an entry with name \"get_weather\" and arguments including \"location\": \"San Francisco\".\n\nI don't see any other functions needed here since there's only one relevant function",
