  "thinkingContent" : "Okay, the user is asking about how to use a calculator. Let me start by recalling what I know about calculators. First, they need basic functions like addition and multiplication. Then there's division and exponentiation.\n\nI should explain each function step by step so that even someone new can follow along without confusion. Maybe start with adding numbers together using the plus sign (+). After that cover multiplication with × or ×× if needed but maybe mention both as it's versatile. Division would be �� or ��÷ but perhaps mention both for clarity.\n\nExponentiation could be raised to a power (^) or using parentheses as well. Maybe include examples like 2^3 = 8, which uses ^, and also showing how parentheses can change the order of operations if needed.\n\nIt's important to highlight that calculators are not just for simple math but can handle complex calculations too. Including a note about common mistakes might be helpful too, like forgetting a function or using incorrect signs"
