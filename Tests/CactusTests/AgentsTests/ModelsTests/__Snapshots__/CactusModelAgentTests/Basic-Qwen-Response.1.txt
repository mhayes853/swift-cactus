      - some: "Okay, the user asked, \"What is the meaning of life?\" and I need to provide an answer. First, I should acknowledge that this question is deeply personal and might not have an easy answer.\n\nI should start by expressing my understanding of what life means to me as someone who values philosophy and contemplation over material success or happiness.\n\nIt\'s important to highlight that the meaning of life varies widely among individuals based on cultural, personal experiences, beliefs systems. Perhaps mention different perspectives from various philosophical traditions.\n\nI should also encourage the user to reflect on their own values and experiences as part of the answer, since personal meaning is key here.\n\nMake sure my tone is thoughtful and open-ended, allowing the user to explore further if they choose to. Avoid providing specific answers but offer a philosophical perspective."
