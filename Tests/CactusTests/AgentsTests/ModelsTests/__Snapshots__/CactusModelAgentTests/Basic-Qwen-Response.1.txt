      - some: "Okay, the user is asking about the meaning of life. That\'s a big question. First off, I need to acknowledge that this is an open and philosophical question. There\'s no single answer because life has different meanings depending on individual perspectives.\n\nI should start by explaining that there isn\'t one universally accepted answer, as it depends on personal values and experiences. Then, perhaps touch upon common themes like purpose, happiness, relationships or self-actualization. But I need to make sure the response is balanced and not too vague.\n\nI should also consider that different cultures might have varying views on what\'s meaningful. So maybe mention that there are many possibilities here. It\'s important to highlight the diversity of human experience without making it a one-size-fits-all answer.\n\nWait, but how do I phrase this in a way that feels natural as a philosopher? Maybe start with \"The question of life’s meaning is inherently personal and varies for each individual.\" Then list possible angles: purpose, happiness"
