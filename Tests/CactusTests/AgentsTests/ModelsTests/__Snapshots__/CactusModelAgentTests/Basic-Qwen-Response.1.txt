Then, in the main file (probably app.py), import Flask and create an instance. Set up routes via route functions and use the @app.route decorator.\n\nWait, but maybe I should also mention installing dependencies like SQLite3 if they need database storage. But since the user didn\'t specify, perhaps start with Flask alone.\n\nThen, for templates, creating an index.html file in \'templates\' directory where users can see their application\'s features. Including some simple HTML elements and adding routes to handle different parts of the app.\n\nI should also cover how"
