Based on your initial message containing just \"get_fact\", it seems you intended to retrieve information using the `get_fact` tool but didn't specify a topic yet.\n\nTo proceed: Please provide the **topic** you'd like me to find facts about (e.g., space, history, science). Once given, I’ll use that exact input with my available functionality:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topic\": \"<your_topic>\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \/\/ No properties needed for get_fact; just a string topic is required.\n}\n```",
