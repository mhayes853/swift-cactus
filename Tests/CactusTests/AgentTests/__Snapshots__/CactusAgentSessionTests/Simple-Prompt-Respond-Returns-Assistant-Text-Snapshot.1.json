It simply signifies that you are writing your first name.\n\nHere's another way to think about it:\n\n*   You are writing your first name, and this new pattern represents the beginning of something different than what you had before using this pattern.*\n\nFor example:\n\n*   If you were writing your first names for friends and family.*\n*   If you were writing for yourself as a professional or aspiring entrepreneur*.\n*  or *something with any meaning in life*.\n",
