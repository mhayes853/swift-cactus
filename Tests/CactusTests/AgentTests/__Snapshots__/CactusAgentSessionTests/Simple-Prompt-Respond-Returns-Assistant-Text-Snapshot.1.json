It's about living in accordance with your values, cultivating relationships, and making decisions that matter. It can be anything from fulfilling your purpose as a person to creating something better than you could without it.\n\nIt resonates deeply for many people who strive for fulfillment through living authentically and ethically even if they don’t find their own path etched in the written word through this profound realization: Ultimately, existence isn’Dwelling on Life...and Living With Meaning!\n",
